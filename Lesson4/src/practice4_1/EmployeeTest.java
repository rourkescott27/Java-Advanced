// This code builds on previous examples involving the Employee superclass and its subclasses
// (Engineer, Manager, Admin, Director). The structure and behavior of those classes is already
// well-documented and will not be repeated here to avoid redundancy.

// The key addition in this version is the use of the EmployeeStockPlan class, which assigns
// different stock option values depending on the employee type using inheritance and instanceof.

// Demonstrates polymorphism and type-based logic using EmployeeStockPlan
